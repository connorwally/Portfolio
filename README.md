## Technical Project Reports Site

This project is a simple React, TypeScript, and Vite site for hosting technical reports on projects.

The main page is structured into:

- **Hero section**: Brief introduction, high-level overview.
- **Projects section**: List of projects, each linking to a dedicated technical writeup.
- **Contact section**: Basic contact information or form so people can reach out.

Each project will have its own technical writeup page, which can include:

- **Images and diagrams** that illustrate architecture, workflows, and results.
- **Sections for key technical features**, design decisions, and implementation details.
- **Sections for hurdles and challenges**, including how you diagnosed and solved them.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
